# PIES Website Frontend

Welcome to **Pilipinos in Engineering and Science (PIES)** website frontend! This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. The PIES website serves as a hub for connecting members, sharing updates, and promoting events.

## Features

- **Newsletter Subscription**: Users can subscribe to the PIES newsletter by providing their name and email address. The form includes validation and a fallback image for enhanced user experience(in progress).
- **Dynamic Content**: The website leverages Next.js's server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) for fast and dynamic content delivery.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS modules, the website is optimized for various screen sizes and devices (in progress)
- **Image Optimization**: Uses Next.js's `Image` component for optimized image loading and fallback handling (in progress).
